This is the git repo for USC's CS 555 class. It is an implementation JOS which is an exo-kernel operating system.

The lab is split into 6 major parts that build on each other, culminating in a primitive operating system on which you can run simple commands through your own shell. We reserve the last lecture for you to demo your operating system to the rest of the class.
The operating system you will build, called JOS, will have Unix-like functions (e.g., fork, exec), but is implemented in an exokernel style (i.e., the Unix functions are implemented mostly as user-level library instead of built-in to the kernel). The major parts of the JOS operating system are:

Booting
Memory management
User environments
Preemptive multitasking
File system, spawn, and shell
Network driver
Open-ended project
