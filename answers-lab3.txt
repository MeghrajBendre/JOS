PART A: Answers
---------------

1. Individual handler function for each exception/interrupt are provided to separate user handler calls from kernel calls. It avoids user interference in kernel's call to certain exception/interrupt handlers. In simple words, it is just a protection mechanism implemented using individual function handler for each exception/interrupt.

2. No changes were required to make user/softint program behave correctly. The priviledge level required by page fault handler is zero (DPL), which user dose not have. So, call to "int 14" generates a "general protection fault" which inturns triggers interrupt vector 13. 

3. It works in this way to make sure that the user mode program has appropriate priviledges to trigger break point trap handler. Setting the DPL=3 gives user mode program priviledge to call breakpoint trap handler. DPL=0 will does not grant user mode program required priviledge and instead the general protection fault is triggered.

4. This helps in avoiding calls by user mode to the exceptions and trap handlers which are meant to be called by the kernel. It is just a protection mechanism.
